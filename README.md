# rwalk
A little bit of noodling around with libpng, with a constrained random walk as the source for the image.

## Building
If you're interested in having your <i>very own</i> random walks, you'll need libpng and libz. The remainder of the process should be pretty straightforward. While I've only tested this on Linux, it should be pretty portable, as long as the platform supports libpng.

## Running
Run with the command-line arguments `rwalk <save file path> <number of steps> [optional: <height> <width>]`.
